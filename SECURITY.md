# Security Policy

TGPro takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and security best practices for users.

## üîí Security Overview

### Current Security Measures

TGPro implements multiple layers of security:

#### üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection
- **AES-256 Encryption**: All sensitive data (API credentials, tokens) encrypted at rest
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with proper expiration
- **Session Management**: Encrypted session storage with automatic cleanup
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Pydantic models
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password hashing using industry standards

#### üöß Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks
- **API Key Authentication**: Bearer token authentication for all API endpoints
- **Request Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized to prevent injection attacks

#### üîê Authentication Security
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support for Telegram 2FA
- **Secure Session Handling**: Automatic session expiration and cleanup
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh to minimize exposure
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force login attempts

## üìä Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Life |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 3.1.x   | ‚úÖ Full Support    | TBD         |

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

#### üî¥ Critical Vulnerabilities
For **critical vulnerabilities** (RCE, data breach, authentication bypass):

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email**: security@tgpro.dev (if available) or use private disclosure
3. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, impact assessment
4. **Timeline**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

#### üü° Non-Critical Vulnerabilities
For **non-critical vulnerabilities** (information disclosure, DoS):

1. Create a **private security advisory** on GitHub
2. Or email with full details
3. **Timeline**: Response within 72 hours

### What to Include

Please provide the following information:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, etc.)
- **Location** (file, function, endpoint affected)
- **Impact** assessment (what can an attacker do?)
- **Steps to reproduce** with detailed instructions
- **Proof of concept** code or screenshots
- **Suggested fix** if you have one
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå **Don't** publicly disclose the vulnerability before we've had a chance to fix it
- ‚ùå **Don't** access or modify data that doesn't belong to you
- ‚ùå **Don't** perform destructive testing (DoS, data deletion, etc.)
- ‚ùå **Don't** social engineer our team or users
- ‚ùå **Don't** perform testing on production systems without permission

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Response Process

### Our Response Timeline

1. **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours (critical) or 72 hours (non-critical)
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 48 hours
3. **Investigation**: 3-7 days depending on complexity
4. **Fix Development**: 1-14 days depending on severity
5. **Testing**: 1-3 days
6. **Deployment**: Coordinated with reporter
7. **Public Disclosure**: 90 days after fix deployment (negotiable)

### Response Actions

Depending on the severity, we may:
- Issue immediate hotfix for critical vulnerabilities
- Release security patch in next scheduled update
- Provide temporary workarounds
- Update documentation with security recommendations
- Notify affected users if necessary

## üîß Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment Security

#### üåê Production Deployment
- **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with SSL/TLS certificates
- **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the application and dependencies updated
- **Monitor Logs**: Implement log monitoring for suspicious activity
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular encrypted backups with tested restore procedures

#### üîë Credential Management
- **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- **2FA Enabled**: Enable two-factor authentication where available
- **API Key Security**: Never hardcode API keys, use environment variables
- **Regular Rotation**: Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- **Access Control**: Implement principle of least privilege

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database Security
- **MongoDB Security**: Enable authentication and use SSL connections
- **Network Isolation**: Use private networks and firewalls
- **Regular Backups**: Encrypted backups stored securely
- **Access Logging**: Monitor database access and queries
- **Connection Limits**: Implement connection limits and timeouts

### Application Security

#### üîí Authentication Security
```python
# Example: Secure JWT configuration
JWT_SETTINGS = {
    "algorithm": "HS256",
    "expire_minutes": 30,  # Short expiration
    "refresh_expire_days": 7,
    "secret_key": os.getenv("JWT_SECRET_KEY"),  # From environment
}
```

#### üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation
```python
# Example: Proper input validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class UserInput(BaseModel):
    message: str
    
    @validator('message')
    def validate_message(cls, v):
        if len(v) > 1000:
            raise ValueError('Message too long')
        # Sanitize input
        return html.escape(v.strip())
```

#### üö´ Rate Limiting
```python
# Example: Rate limiting configuration
RATE_LIMITS = {
    "login": "5/minute",
    "api_calls": "100/minute",
    "message_send": "10/minute",
}
```

### Infrastructure Security

#### üåê Network Security
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
- **VPN Access**: Use VPN for administrative access
- **Load Balancer**: Use load balancer with SSL termination
- **DDoS Protection**: Implement DDoS protection services
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for anomalies

#### üìä Monitoring and Logging
```yaml
# Example: Security monitoring configuration
monitoring:
  failed_logins:
    threshold: 5
    window: "5m"
    action: "block_ip"
  
  suspicious_activity:
    - multiple_api_keys
    - unusual_traffic_patterns
    - failed_authentication_attempts
    
  log_retention: "90d"
  log_encryption: true
```

## üö® Security Incidents

### If You Suspect a Breach

If you suspect your TGPro installation has been compromised:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Change all passwords and API keys
   - Review access logs for suspicious activity
   - Temporarily disable the application if necessary
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check system logs for unauthorized access
   - Review database for data modifications
   - Analyze network traffic logs
   - Identify the attack vector

3. **Recovery**:
   - Update to the latest version
   - Apply all security patches
   - Restore from clean backups if necessary
   - Implement additional security measures

4. **Reporting**:
   - Report the incident to appropriate authorities if required
